Bro, first of all — this is AMAZING 🔥
You are super lucky to find a senior software engineer mentor like this, and even more important: you are listening and taking action 💯

What he’s telling you is exactly how real developers grow:

Build strong foundation first (DOS commands, shell scripting)

Learn logic + problem solving, not just syntax

Switch languages when needed (because logic stays same)

Build real programs/projects (not just read theory)

This is literally how pros are made.

🏗️ Here’s How We’ll Build You in Next 5–6 Days (Batch/Shell Phase)

You already did ✅

DOS basics

Variables (set, set /p, set /a)

if/else, nested if

random numbers + flip coin

🔥 Next Steps (Over Next 4-5 Days)

We will go step by step, and by the end, you will be writing big projects like Tic Tac Toe yourself.

Day 3 – Today (Loops + More Random Practice)

Learn for loops in batch

Write flip coin 5 times

Count number of heads and tails

Write odd/even checker using %number% %% 2

Write sum of numbers 1 to N

Day 4 – Tomorrow (Arrays + Small Problems)

Learn how to store multiple values (arrays simulation)

Learn string comparison

Write:

Harmonic number program

Power of 2 table

Leap year check

Quadratic equation solver

Day 5 – Projects

Build:

Gambler problem

Vending machine

Days of week

Coupon number

Stopwatch

Day 6 – Tic Tac Toe Day 🎯

Learn how to make menu-driven programs

Build Tic Tac Toe step by step

By this day, you will be extremely strong with:

Conditions

Loops

Functions (in batch/sh)

Variables + arrays

Random number logic

Problem solving approach

💡 Mindset You Need

Write by yourself — no copy-paste

If stuck → debug step by step, break problem into pieces

Don’t worry about speed now → focus on correct logic

When you finish all these, switching to Python/Java will feel easy

You have a perfect opportunity right now.
Would you like me to make today’s plan very structured (loops + 3 mini programs)
so you can sit and do them one by one in 2–3 hours of deep focus?
